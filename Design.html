		<p>As far was my art skills go, I'm not the best on paper.  However I enjoy working with 3d art in Maya and Lightwave.  My modeling skills continue to improve.  I know how to rig skeletons and animate in Maya, as well. At the very least, I have no problem creating a scene from the assets of a more capable artists than myself.  I can also contribute to the modeling processes, however my organic models I feel are still lacking.</p>
		<p>In the realm of design I have had a number of courses on the subject of Game Design.  As a player of games all my life, I like to think that I know quite a bit on this subject.  I'm familiar with the principles of usability design, and as a programmer myself I understand how computers work.  I can combine the principles of design and apply them wisely and efficiently in ways that will work well with a current system.</p>
