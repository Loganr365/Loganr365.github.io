	<p>A lighthearted physics game created by me and a team of three others.  I served as the lead game designer and oversaw that my original game concept became reality.  I assigned roles and tasks to the other group members, as well as provided support to each of them</p>	
	<p> Throughout the course of the project, I worked with our lead programmer to help create the scripting required for user input detection, user movement in the virtual world, and user interaction with other physics objects in the virtual world.  I also helped the lead artist with the integration of his assets in the game world, and with the creation of assets.</p>
	<p>Specifically, I created the user avatar, and all the scripting required for the movement and interaction of the user with the world and other objects in the world.</p>
