<p>This was a fairly straighforward project.  I created a basic unity scene, a small village with about four or five small buildings in it.  The scene is inhabitied by two factions of knights, the evil Dark Knights, and the Heroic White Knights.  The White Knights follow their leader who patrols the path of the village.  The Black Knights seak out the white knights, and when they get close enough destroy the white knight.  White knights will respawn and contuinue to follow or patrol, thus this never ending conflict between good and evil contunies.</p>
<p>All scripting for the "scene" was done by myself, as well as the creation of the models.  Used default unity textures to paint the landscape.  This was created over the course of about three weeks of off and on work.  I learned how to program basic pathfollowing, leader following, flocking, and seeking algorthims as a result of this project.</p>
