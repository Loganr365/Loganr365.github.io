	<p>Sparklegore is a simple hack'n'slash infinite runner.  The screen will constantly scroll upwards, and the player must attempt to stay on the screen as long as possible.  This is done by jumping from platform to platform and brutally defeating cute fairy girls that will try and push you off.  The player gains energy as time passes and extra from defeating a fairy.  This energy is used to build walls slightly in front of the player that can be used to aid in a jump or to block a fairy.  </p>
	
	<p>This was a group project made with three other students.  We had an artists who created the game assets and programmed the animations.  Another member of the group also programmed the UI for the game.  The map in the game is initial read in from a text file, I created the logic for reading this map.  After the initial load tiles are randomly spawned on the screen based on a variable interval, they will always be in a spot that the player can jump too.  I programed the logic for the platform generation.  The player's ability to build walls was also programmed by myself.  Movement and collision detection was handled by another member of the group.</p>
	
	<p>The four of us created this game over the course of one month, in addition to all our other school work.  This was a project during our freshmen year and was giving to us on an intentionally tight schedule.  Unfortunately the group disbanded after the project and we where never able to improve on the project.  Im looking to do so in the future, once I have received the permission from the old group members to further the project on my own.</p>
